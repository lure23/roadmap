## Aim

- To be able to craft 20..40mm PVC piping to specific (2D) curvature

I need one such arc for finishing the [June](../Jun-23/README.md) work on semi-arc sturdiness. In the future, ability to do custom curved sections for the track itself will be needed.


>*Note: Would be nice to know the same for aluminum, as well, but that calls for [tougher measures](https://youtu.be/e2hU_XfZkO8) (Youtube, 9:45). Not going there, at this point.*




## Requirements

- Licenses:
   - [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/pricing) CAD; free account will do

<!-- #redo
- Access to:
  - ![](.images/laser-cutter.png) a [laser cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting)
  - ![](.images/sanding-machine.png) sanding machine
  - ![](.images/table-drill.png) table drill

- Materials:
  - Plywood (3mm): roughly 770 x 350 mm

     >Note: The dimensions don't need to be exactly that. You can rearrange the parts at cutting.

  - 2+4 wheels

     >The size of the wheels can vary - just adjust the CAD model accordingly.

  - Two blocks of wood
  - 1m M6 threaded rod (used in 6 pieces; each 10..15cm)

     >Use rod pieces you have "hanging around". :)

  - handful (10..12) M6 nuts (preferably flanged) and/or wing nuts
  - ca. 1m pieces of two aluminum pipes

     >Design uses 40mm and 25mm pipes, but you can use what is available. "Just" adjust the CAD model. ðŸ˜œ

   - wood glue

### Budget

The author paid 9 eur for the plywood, getting the other parts free of charge from a local Hacklab.

|||
|---|---|
|Plywood|ca. 9 eur|
|wheels x 2+4|<10 eur|
|Aluminum pipes|< 5 eur|
|Steel threaded rod 1m, M6|< 2 eur|
|nuts M6|5..10 eur|
|total|< 25 eur|

Making the stand takes perhaps 2h, and the same for the bogey. Depends hugely on your skills, but let's say "a day" should always do.
