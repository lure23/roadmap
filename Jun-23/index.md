## Aim

![](.images/semi-arc.png)
*Image 1. Semi-arc (straight) model*

To design and build the semi-arch shown in Image 1.

The model is meant for studying the manufacturability using carbon fibre tubes, fitted with 3D-printed parts to aluminum main rails and arc.

## Tests

**Test setup**

The semi-arc pictured in Image 1 assembled. 

- Left side tied to a stationary pole = not moving
- Test force applied to the rightmost tip in the picture (C1)

### Test 1

- Mark the horizontal and vertical position of the tips (A1, C1) without applying force
- Do the same with 5kg weights hanging from C1
- Measure the vertical and horizontal displacements

**Expectation**

*Not sure. Gut feel is that <5cm vertical displacement would be "fine". Really testing the waters, here.*

**Results**

| point                      | displacement (dx,dy) in mm |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| C1 |                            |
| A1 |                            |

### Test 2

Repeat Test 1, with the 5kg pulling *upwards* in C1.

**Results**

<!-- Video would have e.g.
- components and costs 
- learnings

Based on the video, one should be able to replicate the work.
