**Demo**

To have a miniature (roughly 1:10) monorail track, running in a park.

- [ ] Able to walk under it
- [ ] Remote controlled
- [ ] With switches

**Learning**

Each of the sessions tackles some uncertainties, that need to be managed, and reduces the funnel of unknowns. Ultimately, step by step, we end up doing a park demo as just collecting together things learned in particular sessions.
